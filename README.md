Hey there, It is just a simple counter project using the react and react Hooks.
In this project I have used the basiz concept of react Hooks. It is just a start of react Hooks. 

Basically, in this project I have used the  
### "useState()" 
as the Hook.

# Hooks
are the functions which "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. 

It does not work inside classes.

The project is very simplpe but I will expalin it that It has mainly two Buttons, one is used for 
# Increase Number
and othe is used for 
# Decrease Number
The 
# number
is just a number of clicks we made in a particular button.

This all is done using 
# React Hooks


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
